This is a backpropogation neural network I wrote in 2018-19 as a part of an independent study I did on machine learning. It's rather rudimentary,
and the code itself is not written in my current style (which has changed significantly in the last three years), but it shows my understanding of the topic,
as well as my ability to implement the project itself.
